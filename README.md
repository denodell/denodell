# 👋 Hi, I’m Den Odell

**Frontend Architect · Author · Developer**  
Built web apps used by millions. Wrote the books that teach others how.

I'm a web engineer with 25+ years of experience, specializing in fast, accessible, and scalable UI architecture.

I’ve worked with global brands like **Canva**, **Volvo Cars**, **Nike**, **UNICEF**, **AKQA**, and **MINI**, and authored two JavaScript books used in universities and cited in academic research. Today, I’m building tools and methodologies that help engineering teams ship better products.
